However, based on the structure and outputs in the document, here\u2019s an inferred description and a sample prompt that would produce a report like this.\n\nWhat the grading agent appears to do:\n- Use a rubric with three sections: Patient Summary (18 items), Diagnosis (3 items), Plan (4 items).\n- For each student, check whether each rubric item is present in the AI note and in the human note using keyword/semantic matching.\n- Award points per matched item and compute section totals, overall totals, and the difference (AI \u2212 Human).\n- List \u201cUnmatched checked phrases\u201d (e.g., \u201cDX: other metastatic\u201d) that were present but didn\u2019t match the rubric items directly.\n- Add a brief narrative indicating whether scores match or where discrepancies occur. In discrepancy cases, the report notes that items marked \u201c7\u201d likely reflect human graders awarding credit for alternate phrasing.\n\nSample system prompt (inferred):\n\u201cYou are an automated grading agent for patient notes. Given two notes per student (AI-generated and human-written) and a fixed rubric with:\n- Patient Summary (18 checklist items),\n- Diagnosis (3 checklist items),\n- Plan (4 checklist items),\nidentify the presence of each checklist item in each note using keyword and synonym-based matching. Award 1 point per matched item per section. Compute section scores and overall totals for AI and Human, as well as the difference (AI \u2212 Human). Record any phrases present that do not map to a rubric item under \u2018Unmatched checked phrases\u2019. For each student, output:\n- Name\n- Section scores: Patient Summary, Diagnosis, Plan (AI Score, Human Score, Max)\n- Total scores (AI, Human, Max) and Difference\n- A per-item checklist indicating matched vs not matched\n- Unmatched checked phrases\n- A short narrative noting whether AI and human scores match or describing discrepancies.\nBe consistent across students and preserve the rubric order of items. If human graders award credit for alternate phrasing not in the checked list, flag those items accordingly in the per-item view and note this in the narrative.\u201d\n\nIf you can share the actual agent configuration or prompt text, I can compare it to this and refine the reconstruction."}, "timestamp": "2025-10-15T21:48:50.604353", "id": "accff67e-fed2-49f1-a364-f76add28df30", "stored_at": "2025-10-15T21:48:50.604385"}

What are you studying, and what would you like help with today? I can explain tricky concepts, walk through problems step by step, brainstorm essay ideas, create a study plan, or help find reliable sources.\n\nIf you share your level (high school, undergrad, grad) and any upcoming deadlines or exams, I can tailor advice and even draft a quick schedule. How\u2019s your semester going so far, and what\u2019s on your plate right now?"}, "timestamp": "2025-11-04T18:08:22.588085", "id": "5c1c8820-54c6-4820-bc70-7816d574d068", "stored_at": "2025-11-04T18:08:22.588101"}
{"user_input": "What is machine learning?", "task_type": "chat", "agent_responses": {"chat": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions, instead of being explicitly programmed for every task.\n\nHow it works in practice:\n- You collect data and define the problem (e.g., predict house prices, detect spam).\n- You choose a model (a mathematical pattern finder).\n- You train the model on example data so it adjusts its internal parameters to reduce errors.\n- You evaluate it on new, unseen data to check how well it generalizes.\n- You deploy it and monitor performance over time.\n\nMain types:\n- Supervised learning: Learns from labeled examples. Used for classification (spam vs. not spam) and regression (predicting prices).\n- Unsupervised learning: Finds structure in unlabeled data. Used for clustering (customer segments) and dimensionality reduction (PCA).\n- Reinforcement learning: Learns by trial and error with rewards and penalties. Used in game-playing agents, robotics, and recommendation strategies.\n- Semi/self-supervised learning: Use small amounts of labels or create labels from the data itself to learn more efficiently.\n\nCommon algorithms:\n- Linear/logistic regression, decision trees and random forests, support vector machines,\n- K-means clustering, PCA,\n- Neural networks and deep learning for complex tasks like vision and language.\n\nWhy it\u2019s useful:\n- Handles complex, high-dimensional patterns,\n- Improves with more data,\n- Can adapt to changing conditions.\n\nLimitations to keep in mind:\n- Needs quality, representative data and computational resources,\n- Can overfit or fail when the real-world data shifts,\n- May inherit biases present in the training data,\n- Some models are hard to interpret.\n\nRelationship to AI:\n- AI is the broader goal of making machines intelligent.\n- Machine learning is a subset of AI focused on learning from data.\n- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks.\n\nIf you want, tell me the context you care about (e.g., business, healthcare, coding) and I can tailor examples or walk you through a simple demo."}, "timestamp": "2025-11-12T20:32:27.915926", "id": "3ec886dc-bf7f-41bc-bb8e-2e873ff86a06", "stored_at": "2025-11-12T20:32:27.915952"}
