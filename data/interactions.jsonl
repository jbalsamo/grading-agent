However, based on the structure and outputs in the document, here\u2019s an inferred description and a sample prompt that would produce a report like this.\n\nWhat the grading agent appears to do:\n- Use a rubric with three sections: Patient Summary (18 items), Diagnosis (3 items), Plan (4 items).\n- For each student, check whether each rubric item is present in the AI note and in the human note using keyword/semantic matching.\n- Award points per matched item and compute section totals, overall totals, and the difference (AI \u2212 Human).\n- List \u201cUnmatched checked phrases\u201d (e.g., \u201cDX: other metastatic\u201d) that were present but didn\u2019t match the rubric items directly.\n- Add a brief narrative indicating whether scores match or where discrepancies occur. In discrepancy cases, the report notes that items marked \u201c7\u201d likely reflect human graders awarding credit for alternate phrasing.\n\nSample system prompt (inferred):\n\u201cYou are an automated grading agent for patient notes. Given two notes per student (AI-generated and human-written) and a fixed rubric with:\n- Patient Summary (18 checklist items),\n- Diagnosis (3 checklist items),\n- Plan (4 checklist items),\nidentify the presence of each checklist item in each note using keyword and synonym-based matching. Award 1 point per matched item per section. Compute section scores and overall totals for AI and Human, as well as the difference (AI \u2212 Human). Record any phrases present that do not map to a rubric item under \u2018Unmatched checked phrases\u2019. For each student, output:\n- Name\n- Section scores: Patient Summary, Diagnosis, Plan (AI Score, Human Score, Max)\n- Total scores (AI, Human, Max) and Difference\n- A per-item checklist indicating matched vs not matched\n- Unmatched checked phrases\n- A short narrative noting whether AI and human scores match or describing discrepancies.\nBe consistent across students and preserve the rubric order of items. If human graders award credit for alternate phrasing not in the checked list, flag those items accordingly in the per-item view and note this in the narrative.\u201d\n\nIf you can share the actual agent configuration or prompt text, I can compare it to this and refine the reconstruction."}, "timestamp": "2025-10-15T21:48:50.604353", "id": "accff67e-fed2-49f1-a364-f76add28df30", "stored_at": "2025-10-15T21:48:50.604385"}
