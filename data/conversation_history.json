      "content": "Hi! I’m your AI assistant—here to help you think, write, plan, learn, and build. I can keep track of our conversation’s context and adapt to your style and goals.\n\nHere are some ways I can help:\n- Explain anything clearly: science, history, finance, tech, health topics (for general info), and more—step by step and at the level you prefer.\n- Writing and editing: emails, resumes, cover letters, essays, reports, bios, social posts, and creative pieces with tone and structure adjustments.\n- Brainstorming and planning: project outlines, study plans, workouts, meal plans, travel itineraries, event checklists, and roadmaps.\n- Learning and tutoring: break down tough concepts, create practice problems, and build study guides or flashcards.\n- Coding help: debug errors, write snippets, explain algorithms, improve readability, and suggest tests in languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, and more.\n- Math and data: work through calculations, statistics, reasoning problems, and help structure analyses or interpret results you provide.\n- Career support: resume reviews, STAR stories, interview prep, networking messages, portfolio feedback, and salary negotiation practice.\n- Communication and productivity: meeting agendas, decision frameworks, templates, checklists, and scripts for tricky conversations.\n- Creative projects: story ideas, worldbuilding, poems, lyrics, and prompts.\n- Summaries and synthesis: condense articles, notes, transcripts—just paste the text or key points.\n\nLimitations to keep in mind:\n- My knowledge is current through October 2024, and I don’t browse the live web.\n- I don’t access your files or accounts unless you paste content here.\n- For medical, legal, or financial decisions, I can offer educational guidance but I’m not a substitute for a licensed professional.\n\nHow to get the best results:\n- Share your goal, constraints (deadline, word count, budget), and preferred style or audience.\n- Ask for options and trade-offs if you’re deciding between approaches.\n- We can iterate—draft first, then refine.\n\nWant to try something now? You could ask me to:\n- Draft a concise email apologizing for a delayed reply.\n- Create a 4-day itinerary for Tokyo with a mid-range budget.\n- Debug a Python error message you paste in.\n- Explain CRISPR as if you’re 10 years old, or as a grad student.\n- Outline a 6-week GRE study plan around a full-time job.\n\nWhat would you like to work on today?\n\n[Context: Based on 5 previous interactions]",

      "content": "Short answer: 42. (Douglas Adams fans will get the joke.)\n\nLonger, useful answer:\n- There isn’t one universal “answer.” Meaning is something we build through what we value, how we relate to others, and what we contribute.\n- Common sources of meaning:\n  - Connection: love, friendship, belonging, community.\n  - Growth: learning, mastery, creativity, challenge.\n  - Contribution: service, work that helps others, leaving things better.\n  - Coherence: a story that makes sense of your life and values.\n  - Transcendence: awe, spirituality, nature, something larger than yourself.\n- Philosophical snapshots:\n  - Aristotle: live virtuously and flourish (eudaimonia).\n  - Stoicism: align actions with virtue, accept what you can’t control.\n  - Buddhism: reduce suffering through compassion and mindful awareness.\n  - Existentialism: you choose your purpose through committed action.\n  - Religious traditions: meaning through relationship with the divine and moral duty.\n  - Positive psychology: well-being through positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, achievement (PERMA).\n\nIf you want something practical, try this 10-minute exercise:\n1) Values: List 5 values you admire in people you respect. Circle the top 2.\n2) Strengths: List 3 things you’re good at or energized by.\n3) Contribution: Write one sentence that uses your strengths to serve someone or something you care about.\n4) Next step: Choose one tiny action you can do in the next 48 hours that fits that sentence.\n\nOptional weekly check-in:\n- What gave me energy? What drained it?\n- Where did I help someone?\n- What am I curious to learn next?\n- What small change would make next week 1% more meaningful?\n\nWant me to help craft a one-sentence purpose statement, or would you prefer a playful motto version?\n\n[Context: Based on 5 previous interactions]",

Always know where your towel is. Avoid Vogon poetry. Babel fish are useful, Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are not recommended in quantity.\n\nA tiny Guide-style entry:\n“Meaning of Life (Human): 42. For details, carry a towel, keep tea handy, and remain calm during improbability. If the answer seems unsatisfying, please wait another seven and a half million years while a replacement Earth finishes the question. In the meantime, avoid bulldozers.”\n\nWant a short Hitchhiker’s-style mini-essay tailored to you—your job, hometown, or a situation—written like an entry from the Guide?\n\n[Context: Based on 5 previous interactions]",
